# dCC LMS

This is a fork of the Instructure Canvas LMS custom fitted for devCodeCamp. The fork will be up-to-date with the original with the exception of three branches.

### sandbox
The sandbox branch is where the incoming updates from Instructure will meet the existing modifications of the dCC fork.

### dcc-dev
This is the dCC dev branch which pulls from sandbox once conflicts are reconciled.

### dcc-deploy
This is the production branch for the dCC LMS, pulled from working, tested versions of dcc-dev.
